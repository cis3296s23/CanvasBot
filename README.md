# CanvasBot
CanvasBot is a Discord bot that integrates with the Canvas API to provide a seamless experience for both students and professors. The bot allows students to access their course materials, receive notifications about assignments and deadlines, and interact with other students in their classes. Professors are able to use the bot to post announcements, grade assignments, and communicate with their students. Authentication is used to ensure students can only access their course information through the bot.

#  How to run
Installation is easy! All you need is Discord, a Discord account, and a server. Next, click [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1075548726313111594&permissions=2483030064&scope=bot) to invite the bot to any server you have administrator privileges in. The bot is now in your server and is ready to be used. You may also need to give the bot administrator privileges to push notifications and send messages in authorized channels.

# How to build
The bot's command structure uses the `&` symbols as a prefix. To run a command simply preface your message with this. Some examples:
```
&upcoming
```
Displays upcoming assignments
```
&help
```
